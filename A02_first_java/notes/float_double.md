# float vs double in JAVA

In Java, `float` and `double` are data types used to represent decimal numbers with varying levels of precision.

`float` is a 32-bit single-precision floating-point type, which can store values with up to 7 decimal digits of
precision. It is suitable for most general-purpose floating-point calculations.

`double` is a 64-bit double-precision floating-point type, offering higher precision with up to 15 decimal digits. It is
commonly used for scientific calculations or situations where higher accuracy is required.

In summary, `float` is less precise but takes up less memory, while `double` provides higher precision at the cost of
slightly more memory usage. The choice between them depends on the specific requirements of the application.
