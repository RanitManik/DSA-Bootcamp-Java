# Understanding Character Input with Scanner in Java

In the given Java code snippet:

```java
Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
char op = in.next().trim().charAt(0);
```

1. We create a `Scanner` object named `in` to read input from the standard input (usually the keyboard).

2. `in.next()` is used to read a string input from the user. This means the user can enter one or more characters.

3. `.trim()` is called on the input string to remove any leading or trailing whitespace. This ensures that any extra spaces or newline characters are removed.

4. `.charAt(0)` extracts the first character from the trimmed input string. Since strings in Java are zero-indexed (the first character is at index 0), this line of code retrieves the first character entered by the user.

So, at the end of this code snippet, the variable `op` will contain the first character that the user entered, and you can use it for further processing in your Java program.

This code allows you to read a single character as input from the user and store it in the variable `op` for use in your program like i have used it in the calculator.java file.
