# literals in JAVA

In Java, a literal is a constant value that is used directly in your code. It's a way to represent fixed values in a
program. For example, `5` is a literal representing the integer value 5, and `3.14` is a literal representing the
floating-point value 3.14.

Here are some common types of literals in Java:

1. **Integer Literals**: These represent whole numbers without any decimal point. For example, `0`, `123`, `-500`, etc.

2. **Floating-Point Literals**: These represent numbers with a decimal point or in scientific notation. For
   example, `3.14`, `2.0`, `1.2345e3` (which represents 1234.5), etc.

3. **Character Literals**: These represent a single character enclosed in single quotes. For
   example, `'A'`, `'3'`, `'\n'` (newline character), etc.

4. **String Literals**: These represent a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes. For
   example, `"Hello"`, `"123"`, etc.

5. **Boolean Literals**: There are only two boolean literals in Java: `true` and `false`.

6. **Null Literal**: The keyword `null` represents a reference that does not point to any object.

Here are some examples:

```java
int num=42;       // Integer literal
        double pi=3.14;   // Floating-point literal
        char letter='A';  // Character literal
        String message="Hello"; // String literal
        boolean isTrue=true;    // Boolean literal
        Object obj=null;        // Null literal
```

These literals provide a way to represent constant values in your code without having to calculate them or define them
elsewhere. They are often used for initializing variables or passing values to methods.
