# Scoping of loops in Java

---

## For Loop

Use when you know the number of iterations in advance, like going through an array.

```java
for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
        // Code to execute
        }
```

## While Loop

Use when you don't know how many iterations are needed.

```java
while(condition){
        // Code to execute
        }
```

## Do-While Loop

Similar to `while`, but ensures the code block runs at least once.

```java
do{
        // Code to execute
        }while(condition);
```
