# Debugging TypeCasting in this code

```java
float area = ((float) (1 / 2) * (b * h));
        System.out.println("The area of the triangle: is " + area);
```
Your code seems to be written in Java and it calculates the area of a triangle based on the input of its base and height. However, there's a small mistake in the formula.

In Java, when you perform arithmetic operations with integers, the result is also an integer. So, in this line:

```java
float area = ((float) (1 / 2) * (b * h));
```

The expression `(1 / 2)` is evaluated first, which results in `0` because both `1` and `2` are integers. Then, this `0` is converted to a float, which remains `0`. This means your area calculation always results in `0`.

To fix this, you should make sure that at least one of the operands in `(1 / 2)` is a float. You can do this by using `1.0` instead of `1`:

```java
float area = ((float) (1.0 / 2) * (b * h));
```

Alternatively, you can simply write:

```java
float area = (0.5f * (b * h));
```

Both of these options will give you the correct area calculation.
