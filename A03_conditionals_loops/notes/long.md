# Long Variable

A "**long variable**" typically refers to a data type in programming languages, often used to store integer values that
require a larger range than a standard integer type. It usually occupies more memory space.

For example, in languages like Java or C#, a "long" data type can store a wider range of values compared to an "int"
data type.

Here's an example in Java:

```java
long myLongVariable=1234567890L;
```

In this example, `myLongVariable` is a variable of type `long` and it's assigned the value `1234567890`. The `L` at the
end of the number indicates that it's a long literal.

Keep in mind that the specific details may vary depending on the programming language you're using. If you have a
specific language in mind, feel free to ask for an example in that language!
